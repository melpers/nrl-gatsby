Project Specialist. A non-aeronautically designated individual (military or civilian) embarked in a government aircraft for the purpose of operating aircraft systems, operating specially designed equipment, or observing aircraft or crew performance, etc. when required in conjunction with assigned duties or contractual responsibilities. Project specialists are not responsible for normal aircrew duties.
To be properly qualified to fly aboard NRL aircraft, you will need two things:

A current [Class II FAA up-chit](https://www.faa.gov/pilots/amelocator/) and
Documentation of successfully completing the [NP4 survival swim and physiology training course](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/vxs1/project-specialist/np4-training).

Your branch head should initiate the Project Specialist designation by providing the following information to the Project Swim/Phys Coordinator (202-767-2271) who will make a reservation for you to attend training:

- Full Name
- SSN
- Project Name
- Office Code
- Phone
- NP4 Expiration Date (If available)
- Flight Physical Expiration Date
- Nationality

**NP4 Physiology and Water Survival Training**

The purpose of aviation physiology training is to familiarize all prospective and designated aeronautical personnel, selected passengers, project specialists, and any other authorized personnel with the aero medical aspects of flight and prepare them to properly employ ALSS and survival procedures.

NP4, is required for all project specialists and is valid for 48 months in the same category aircraft.

[View the ASTC PAX Training Schedule](http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmotc/nsti/Pages/ASTCPatuxentRiver.aspx)

Note: The first time that you complete this training, you will need to attend class III swim training and the NP4 training. After that, you will only need to attend the second day of training (NP4). If you have been previously qualified, but feel that you may need more practice with the swim strokes, etc., please attend both days.

For access to NAS Patuxent River for medical reasons or to attend swim training, please call the VXS-1 Project Office at 301-342-8975.

Topics covered in this training include:

**Aviation Physiology**: Classroom presentation and low-pressure chamber flight (when applicable) on the effects of altitude on the human body. The principles of cardiovascular and respiratory physiology are emphasized. Presentation primarily covers hypoxia, hyperventilation, trapped gas, evolved gas (decompression sickness), and aviation oxygen systems.

**Sensory Physiology**: Classroom presentation and training device evolution (when applicable) that continues discussing the effects of altitude on the human body. Specifically, the stressors of flight that affect sensory adaptation (acceleration, darkness, lack of visual cues, visual illusions, etc.) are covered. Disorientation, temporal distortion, motion sickness caused by flight, and situational awareness are also typical topics for discussion. Depending on the aircraft type (jet, propeller, helicopter, etc.), special protective devices, such as night vision devices, laser protection, and threats such as lasers are also discussed.

**Emergency Egress/Systems**: Classroom presentation and dynamic training evolutions (where available/appropriate) on emergency egress/systems. Lecture for tactical jets emphasizes the psychological aspects of the ejection decision, aeromedical aspects of ejection, windblast, flailing injuries, seat-man separation, parachute opening, parachute descent (over land), and landing. Emergency ground egress is also covered. Lecture for cargo/transport/patrol emphasizes bailout, parachute opening, descent (over land), and landing, as well as crash survival. Lecture for helicopters emphasizes crash survival. Note: Ditching for cargo/transport/patrol/helicopters, etc., covered in NAWSTP.

**Aviation Life Support Systems**: Classroom presentation and drills (where available/appropriate) covering applicable ALSS items/survival/rescue equipment utilized by specific aircraft/aircrews. Helmets, anti-exposure systems, flight clothing, survival vests, flotation devices, life rafts, special weapon systems like laser and CBR protection equipment, signaling devices, survival avionics, and anti-g suits for tactical aircrews are typical items discussed.
