VXS-1 operates as a Service Cost Center within the framework of the Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF). Accordingly, costs must be recovered via user fees/stabilized billing rate charges to customers.

Customers are charged based on a fixed billing rate per flight hour and for project-specific reimbursable costs. Additionally, to minimize rates charged to customers, and per NWCF financial policies, projects canceled by customers after work has begun will be charged for all direct costs associated with planning, material issues, and associated overhead expenses.

**Scheduling**

Projects (including both airborne projects and installations) shall not be considered "scheduled" until the Military Support Division (Code 1400) has received an Authorization to Charge Research Division Job Order Number form from the customer.

A project can be "penciled in" on the long-range timeline upon receipt of a Flight Service Request form in order to facilitate planning, but the project shall not be moved to the monthly schedules without an Authorization to Charge.

**Notification**

Project managers are advised that the Authorization to Charge Research Division Job Order Number form should be received no later than 90 days before start of installation. If the form is not received and another project with funding requests the aircraft, sponsors shall be notified, and advised that they are being replaced on the schedule.
