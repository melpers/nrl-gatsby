The “Warlocks” of Scientific Development Squadron (VXS) 1, operate and maintain two NP-3C Orion aircraft, an RC-12 Guardrail, a UV-18 Twin Otter, and numerous TigerShark Unmanned Aircraft Systems. 
VXS-1 aircraft operate worldwide on extended detachments and annually log more than 400 flight hours. 
These aircraft are the sole airborne platforms for numerous projects such as bathymetry, electronic countermeasures, gravity mapping, and radar development research. The squadron has a flawless safety record, having amassed more than 77,000 hours of accident-free flying since 1963.
