The Center for Bio/Molecular Science and Engineering applies knowledge in modern biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering to the solution of problems important to the Navy, Department of Defense, and the Nation. The Center studies complex bio/molecular systems to understand how biology solves difficult structural, functional and sensing problems.

Technological areas currently being studied include molecular and microstructure design, molecular biology, imaging of cells using nanoparticles, sensor design and prototype development for biosurveillance or underwater chemical detection, and energy harvesting.

The Center provides a stimulating environment for cross-disciplinary programs in the areas of immunology, biochemistry, systems biology, electrochemistry, synthetic chemistry, microbiology, microlithography, photochemistry, biophysics, spectroscopy, advanced diagnostics, organic synthesis, and electro-optical engineering.
