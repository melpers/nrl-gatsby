**Microflow Cytometry**
Our group has previously reported a system for three-dimensional particle focusing using chevron-shaped grooves that is robust, simple to fabricate, and compact. Recently, the technology was incorporated into a microflow cytometer system to identify fluorescence-coded microspheres and display the formation of antibody-antigen complexes.

**Biosensor Triage for Traumatic Brain Injury**
No handheld point-of-care (POC) device capable of determining the presence and extent of acute brain injury due to trauma or blast injury currently exists. Such a diagnostic device would decrease the incidence of over- and under-triage of TBI and would expedite administration of appropriate casualty care during forward operations.

**The Antimicrobial Resistance Determinant Microarray (ARDM)**
With improvement in front-line trauma care, efficiency of medical evacuation on the battlefield, and widespread use of body armor, the rate of battlefield mortality has decreased significantly, with increasing numbers of soldiers surviving combat injuries. However, bacterial infections have become increasingly common among military personnel wounded in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).

**Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs)**
Current standoff detection systems determine the presence of biological particles based on their optical and physical properties. However, these rapid detection systems are non-specific in nature, determining only that a biological particle is there, but not its identity. Antibody- and nucleic acid-based point detectors, on the other hand, are capable of specific identification, but can detect only 

**Quantum Dot Biological Nanoassemblies**
The focus of these research efforts is on the development and use of water-soluble semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) conjugated to biological functionalities to produce new and interesting capabilities.

**Underwater Environmental Monitoring**
Programs are ongoing to develop sensor payloads for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVâ€™s) that can be used to detect trace levels of chemicals in the marine environment, including explosives or toxins.

**Detection of Fissile Materials Using Gamma-Ray Induced Formation of Fluorescent Silver Nanoclusters**
We are developing new gamma-radiation detectors that are based on the formation of fluorescent silver nanoclusters. Our approach is to use reverse micelles (RMs) that contain aqueous solutions of silver ions. Upon exposure to gamma-irradiation, the water molecules undergo scission, yielding solvated electrons, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen atoms. This process causes rapid reduction of the silver ions to silver atoms that aggregate into nanoclusters that are often fluorescent. The size of the clusters is constrained by the RM walls which is important because arger clusters are generally not fluorescent.
