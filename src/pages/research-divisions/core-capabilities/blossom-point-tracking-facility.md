The Blossom Point Satellite Command and Tracking Facility (BPTF) provides engineering and operational support to several complex space systems for the Navy and other customers. BPTF is a research and development site that provides a physical and virtual environment for satellite space and ground segment testing, which includes hardware and software from command generation, all the way through to the spacecraft. As a satellite command and control site, BPTF provides direct line-of-sight, and two-way communication services with a spacecraft in multiple bands during all mission phases. BPTF can support concept, mission, and space segment development, and is capable of supporting pre-launch, launch, early on-orbit operations, and mission data collection. BPTF has a robust and resilient architecture and provides cost-effective solutions for multiple satellite programs.
