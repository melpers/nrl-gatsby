The Thermal Systems Section provides research, concept development, engineering design, analysis, analytical model development and performance prediction, fabrication, integration, test, documentation, and on orbit support of thermal systems and subsystems for spacecraft. Thermal Systems manages and maintains dedicated facilities in support of this effort. The section works directly with the Systems Test Section to plan, operate, and execute environmental simulation tests of spacecraft and spacecraft systems, setting requirements, documenting processes, and verifying results.
