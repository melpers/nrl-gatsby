The Spacecraft Engineering Division has multiple cleanroom facilities with cleanliness ratings of Class 100,000, 10,000, and 100; the Class 100 ultraclean environment is for the cleaning, assembly, and acceptance testing of contamination-sensitive spacecraft components and integration of complete spacecraft subsystems. The facility is used primarily to support spacecraft propulsion systems but also supports spacecraft electrical, mechanical and electro-optical payloads and sensor subsystems. The clean rooms are supported by an extensive array of special test equipment (STE) to support the needs of contamination-controlled testing and integration of spaceflight hardware. This STE consists of ultrasonic cleaning equipment, particle counting stations, water purification stations, vacuum drying stations, immersion flush stations, test hardware, electrical checkout stations, rinse stations, inert gas purges, DC power supplies, and tooling and fixtures. High- and low-pressure test panels for helium and nitrogen test gases are permanently mounted to the walls. These panels contain all the necessary gauges, lines, and regulators. The facility also uses a flush and dry station located within an environmentally safe hood.
