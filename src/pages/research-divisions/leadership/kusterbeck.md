Anne Kusterbeck is the Assistant Director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, and Acting Laboratory Head for the Laboratory for Biomolecular Dynamics. In addition, she is a principal investigator on projects to develop biosensor payloads for unmanned underwater vehicles. For more than 25 years she has worked with her colleagues at NRL to develop small antibody-based detectors for explosives and other small-molecular weight contaminants, with an emphasis on field studies that demonstrate sensor capabilities in environmental monitoring and security. She has served as the Navy liaison for Biotechnology to The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP) Materials Group and has co-organized several international workshops on explosives detection and biotechnology for defense applications. Her efforts in technology transfer have been recognized by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Chemical and Biological Defense Program International Award, a Federal Laboratory Consortium Technology Transfer Award and an Office of National Drug Control Policy the Office award. She is also the recipient of numerous NRL awards, including an Edison Patent Award, a 75th Anniversary Innovation Award, several group achievement awards and the 2003 Applied Science Award from the NRL Edison Chapter of Sigma Xi. She received a Bachelor of Science in biology from the College of William and Mary, completed postgraduate work in immunology and biochemistry at the University of Georgia, and holds a Master of Science in Management from the University of Maryland.
