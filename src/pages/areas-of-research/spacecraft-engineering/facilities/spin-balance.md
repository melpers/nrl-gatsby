![Spin Balance test facility](spin_balance.jpg)

The Spin Balance test facility corrects unbalanced spacecraft either by using dynamic or static/coupled measurement techniques to force the spin axis to the principal axis desired of the satellite and verifying the moments of inertia (MOI) on large capacity MOI tables.

The spin balance test facility contains two spin balancing machines (one horizontal and one vertical) to handle the various types of balancing requirements. Both machines are provided with a plane separation network to obtain correction readings directly in the plane of correction.
