The Spacecraft Engineering Division (SED) is a leading expert in spacecraft design, construction, and on-orbit operations. The SED is the focal point for naval spacecraft, and maintains an active, in-house suite of facilities and capabilities to develop satellites from concept to launch and through mission life. The SED has a proven history of integrating multiple complex systems, from research and development, to mission operations, to providing new capabilities. Since 1955, our expansive knowledge of space systems development has included more than 104 spacecraft launches and countless technologies and payloads hosted on other spacecraft missions.
