The Spacecraft Engineering Division (SED) designs, assembles, and tests spacecraft and space experiments, including all aspects of space, launch, and ground support. We analyze and design structures, mechanisms, and a variety of control systems, including attitude, propulsion, reaction, and thermal. We integrate satellite designs, launch vehicles, and satellite-to-boost stages. With a full suite of facilities, the SED functions as a prototype laboratory to ensure designs can be transferred to industry and incorporated into subsequent satellite hardware builds. The SED consults with the Navy Program Office on technical issues involving spacecraft architecture, acquisition, and operation.
