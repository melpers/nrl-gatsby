The Fluid Systems Section designs, analyzes, implements, and verifies advanced single and two-phase thermal fluid systems for space, near space, and spacecraft architectures through model development, prototyping, experimentation, performance characterization, and testing. The section maintains an advanced two-phase heat transfer facility, the transient Loop Heat Pipe, and a Mach 6+ Hypersonic Wind Tunnel facility. The section specializes in Computational Fluid Dynamics, Direct Simulation Monte Carlo, and hypersonic flow simulation techniques. In addition, the section manages in-house and national High Performance Computer cluster assets to maximize computational scope and efficiency.
