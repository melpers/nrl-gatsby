**Light Energy Conversion**
The focus of these research efforts is to understand the principles of the high efficiency of light energy conversion in photosynthesis and utilization and to mimic them in the construction of electronic, sensing, and energy converting devices. The research includes the study of mechanisms and factors controlling light harvesting (nonlinear adaptive antenna systems), charge separation (catalytic reaction centers), and electron transfer channels (molecular wires and switches).

**Bioelectrochemical Systems (BES)**
BES refers to processes that involve electrode reactions catalyzed by microorganisms. Examples include microbially catalyzed oxidation of organic matter at anodes of microbial fuel cells (MFC) and microbial electrolytic cells (MEC); and microbially catalyzed reduction of photosynthetically generated oxygen in microbial solar cells (MSC).
